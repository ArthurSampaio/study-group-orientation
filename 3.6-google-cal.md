##3.6 Optional Assignment: Set up a Google Calendar for your Study Group
If you'd like to offer your community a calendar of events they can import into their own calendars, try using a Google Calendar. To set up, make a new google account, and update the variables in _config.yml under the heading 'Setup Google Calendar'.

You can add events to your calendar by hand, but if you'd like to manage it automatically, there's a script to do so in scripts/updateCalendar.py; instructions for use are at the top of that file and mentioned here as well.

- Follow this link and setup the credentials (follow step 1 and step 2): https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python 
 (In step 2: Download .JSON file in working (scripts) directory).
- Update the variables in scripts/updateCalender.py: 
  (APPLICATION_NAME, CALENDAR_ID, TIME_ZONE_SRT) => (Google Calendar API Quickstart, USER@gmail.com, America/Vancouver)
- Run from scripts/ using: python updateCalendar.py --noauth_local_webserver
- The sample will attempt to open a new window or tab in your default browser. If this fails, copy the URL from the console and   manually open it in your browser.
